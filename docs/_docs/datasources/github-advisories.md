GitHub Advisories is a centralized source of vulnerability intelligence specific to GitHub projects. GitHub advisories may 
or may not be documented in the National Vulnerability Database.

Dependency-Track integrates with GitHub Advisories using the public GraphQL API. In doing so, Dependency-Track is able 
to create a mirror of all GitHub advisory data. The mirror is kept up-to-date on a daily basis, or upon the restarting of the 
Dependency-Track instance.

Credit is provided to GitHub with visual and textual cues on where the data originated.
