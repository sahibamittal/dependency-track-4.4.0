title: v3.0.1
type: minor
---

**Fixes:**

* Fixed data model issue which prevented multiple versions of the same project name from being persisted.
* Fixed issue in admin console which did not properly display the number of team members.

**Upgrade Notes:**

If v3.0.0 was deployed, shutdown Dependency-Track, execute the following statement against the database, 
and deploy v3.0.1.

```sql
/*
Removes the constraint on having a unique project name thus preventing
multiple versions of the project from existing.
https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues/118
*/
ALTER TABLE PROJECT DROP CONSTRAINT PROJECT_NAME_IDX;
```
