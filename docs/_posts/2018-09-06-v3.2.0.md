**Upgrade Notes:**

* The PROJECT_CREATION_UPLOAD permission was introduced in this release. Existing API keys that need the 
ability to dynamically create projects (without providing them full PORTFOLIO_MANAGEMENT permission) 
will need this permission added to their account or through their team membership.

* The SYSTEM_CONFIGURATION permission was introduced in this release. Existing administrative users that
need the ability to perform more general purpose system configurations need to add this permission to their
accounts.

* Upgrades to v3.2.0 can be successfully performed from systems running v3.1.x. If a previous
version is being used, an upgrade to 3.1.x is required prior to upgrading to v3.2.0.
